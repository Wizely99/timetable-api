# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome.

Before contributing it is important to have a brief on the project.

The project uses tailwindcss with its Flowbite components, making nodejs a dependency for this project.

`git flow` is a recommended tool.


## Steps on contributing.

After forking the project:

- First of all decide which feature/bugfix/hotfix you will be adding/or working on.

- Use git flow to create a feature/bugfix/hotfix branch.

```
    git flow feature/bugfix/hotfix start <a-descriptive-name>
```

- After owrking on your feature/bugfix/hotfix, do not merge to develop localy, instead publish to remote and create a pull request. Do the same if you want support in the feature/bugfix/hotfix you are working on.

```
    git flow feature/bugfix/hotfix publish <a-descriptive-name>
```

Hopefull, the pull request will be reviewed and merged.
